I need an in-person female spanish teacher to help me practice and develop my Papi Chulo spanish.

I have online spanish teachers already, but this is a specific thing that can't be done digitally. I'd like to think I vibrate A2 level spanish.

I want to do Day/Street Game "scrimmages" and run practice scenarios.

The language will be sexually suggestive and ideally I'd want to hold your hand while I say some of this stuff.

So basically... practice flirting in person in spanish in public with girls.

My intention is to improve my existing "day game spanish", so that I can BETTER small talk and flirt with women on the street in addition to communicating my sexual interest to them.

My life style and dating philosphies both beleive in telling the Universe what you want.

Speaking of... i need to improve my hippy and brujeria spanish too.

are these things that you can help me with?
